			<h6>Green Furniture and Sustainable Furniture</h6>
			
			<p>Many furniture companies claim their products are “green,” a designation usually referring to material sourcing. Maybe their sofa frames are made out of dumpster-sourced scrap metal or their cushions are filled with used ticker tape. Responsible material sourcing is important, but it does not necessarily make something sustainable; that is, able to exist in perpetuity from an environmental and resource consumption standpoint.Smaller homes tend to discourage excessive consumerism mitigating that behavior’s attendant environmental impact.Smaller homes typically support denser, more transit friendly communities, which, by their very nature.</p></div>

			<h6>Three Sneaky Storage Solutions For Small Spaces</h6>
			
			<p><span>Storage idea #1: Keep what you love and use, get rid of the rest:</span>While not necessarily a “clever” storage idea for small rooms, the first, and perhaps most important thing to do before finding any storage solutions for small spaces is to do an audit of the stuff you’re storing. We know it sounds obvious, but with less stuff to store, there will be fewer storage solutions to find.<br><span>Storage idea #2: Think of your small apartment as a city:</span>For inspiration, let’s think about cities.
